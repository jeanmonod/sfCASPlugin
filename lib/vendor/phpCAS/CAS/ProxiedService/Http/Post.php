 * This class is used to make proxied service requests via the HTTP POST method.

 * Usage Example:
 *		
 *			try {
 * 				$service = phpCAS::getProxiedService(PHPCAS_PROXIED_SERVICE_HTTP_POST);
 * 				$service->setUrl('http://www.example.com/path/');
 *				$service->setContentType('text/xml');
 *				$service->setBody(''<?xml version="1.0"?'.'><methodCall><methodName>example.search</methodName></methodCall>');
 * 				$service->send();
 *				if ($service->getResponseStatusCode() == 200)
 *					return $service->getResponseBody();
 *				else
 *					// The service responded with an error code 404, 500, etc.
 *					throw new Exception('The service responded with an error.');
 *				
 *			} catch (CAS_ProxyTicketException $e) {
 *				if ($e->getCode() == PHPCAS_SERVICE_PT_FAILURE)
 *					return "Your login has timed out. You need to log in again.";
 *				else
 *					// Other proxy ticket errors are from bad request format (shouldn't happen)
 *					// or CAS server failure (unlikely) so lets just stop if we hit those.
 *					throw $e; 
 *			} catch (CAS_ProxiedService_Exception $e) {
 *				// Something prevented the service request from being sent or received.
 *				// We didn't even get a valid error response (404, 500, etc), so this
 *				// might be caused by a network error or a DNS resolution failure.
 *				// We could handle it in some way, but for now we will just stop.
 *				throw $e;
 *			}
